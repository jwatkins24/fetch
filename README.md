# Fetch Assessment

Welcome to my fetch assessment! I look forward to you reading my code and answering your questions. One problem that I encountered during my analysis was that during the import process, all of the transaction data wasn't being brought in and none of the products table was able to be brought in due to an ascii coding issue.
In my email, that's why I couldn't effectively answer the question with definite brands in my top 5 like I wanted to but the SQL code should give you an idea on how I would approach the problem in how I would answer if I did have all of the information. 

Thank you again and look forward to hearing from the team.

Much appreciated,
Jelani Watkins
